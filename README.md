# SciOly
CAD files for 2014-2015 NYC SO competition; mostly consisting of 3D-printed objects. No full assemblies included.

### Compound Machines
* Islip device (base and mass-holding calipers)
* MIT/NYC device (bearing bracket and fulcrum)

### Scrambler
* Islip/MIT/NYC device (backstop, backstop holder, rear axle, ruler/chassis, front axle, launch hook, front axle, front axle pivot for curved rolling)

### Mission Possible
* None of the devices fielded at Islip/MIT/NYC had 3D-printed parts, but ~~useless crap~~ parts made for a concept are included.
